# Symbolic Decimals - 80 Points
> Did you know that you can hide messages with symbols? For example, !@#$%^&*( is 123456789!<br /> Now Try: ^&,*$,&),!@#,*#,!!^,(&,!!$,(%,$^,(%,*&,(&,!!$,!!%,(%,$^,(%,&),!!!,!!$,(%,$^,(%,&^,!)%,!)@,!)!,!@% However, this isn't as easy as you might think.
### Solution
The way the encryption works, can be seen on your keyboard. For example ! is 1 and @ is 2 and based off of that info, you can kind of tell that the entire encrypted message is decimals, so let's decode it. For coma, i assume it's just space since there's no given clue for it whatsoever.
